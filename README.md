# word2vec

A barebones project done to learn what algorithms and methods are involved in natural language processing.

Based on the Kaggle competition for "Question Pair Similarity"

This is a word2vec implementation that computes a cosine similarity between two questions based on a trained positive pointwise mutual information matrix (low level word embeddings)
